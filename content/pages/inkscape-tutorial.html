        Inkscape has become my favorite drawing tool after designing with a commercial CAD
        (computer-aided design) software package for several years. Most of my work drawings
        nowadays are designed in Inkscape. It is truly an amazing piece of open software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inkscape users can be roughly divided into two groups of people.  The first group includes 
        artists and creative people who use Inkscape to produce creative work. 
        The <a href="https://inkscape.org/news/2021/05/07/meet-ozant-liuky-winner-inkscape-11-about-screen-c/">Inkscape 1.1 about screen</a>
        is a perfect example and it's an amazing piece of art work. The second group of people 
        uses Inkscape to produce technical drawings. Those users may treat Inkscape as a 
        downgraded version of a CAD tool, or an upgraded version of a basic drawing tool. 
        This set of slides is mainly designed for the second group of users.  
      </p>

      <p>
        This set of 12 slides is created in Inkscape when I am learning the software. It
        helps me become familiar with Inkscape and later serves as a reference for myself. I
        hope you will find them useful.

        This website contains many Inkscape materials and notes from my blog site. 
        This set of slides was developed in 2019 with Inkscape version 0.92.  We are currently revising it to 
        reflect the current version 1.1. (9/1/2021)
      </p>

        Dmitry Kirsanov's <em>The Book of Inkscape (2nd ed)</em> is going to be published on 10/19/2021. This is 
        a excellent book to learn Inkscape software.
