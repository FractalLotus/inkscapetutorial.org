note: Drawings For Practice

The previous chapters cover most contents of Inkscape extension development.  This 
chapter will describe some drawing ideas for practice.  

## Pythagoras's Theorem

[Chapter 2](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cass/graphics/manual/pdf/ch2.pdf
) of Bill Casselman's 
book *Mathematical Illustrations* book has a drawing (on Page 5) which shows the "graphic 
proof" of the Pythagoras's theorem. The Pythagoras's theorem is, 

> For a right angled triangle with short sides a and b and long side c, c^2 = a^2 + b^2

Let's generate the same drawing in an Inkscape extension. The SVG drawing is shown below.  
The code is available on the github repository for this website. 

<div style="max-width:600px">
  <img class="img-fluid pb-2" src="/images/ext13/pythagoras.svg" alt="proof"> 
</div>

## American Flag

Bill Casselman's book [Chapter 5](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cass/graphics/manual/pdf/ch5.pdf) 
Exercise 5.4 (on Page 5) is to draw an American flag. 
[This webpage](https://www.allstarflags.com/facts/us-flag-specifications/) 
lists the US Flag Specifications. Write an extension to generate the flag drawing. 

<div style="max-width:600px">
  <img class="img-fluid pb-2" src="/images/ext13/flag.svg" alt="american flag"> 
</div>
